# Golpo13 (v2)

A simple social network web app built with React and Express. This is the 2nd version of the [Golpo13](https://golpo13-old.herokuapp.com/) which I built a few years back. The main purpose is to write clean code and use a frontend technology like React.

***We can continue this as an open platform for people!***

***This is not a mobile friendly web app! Not responsive!***

## Installation

The Express server and React client are both served by the Express server.

Mostly if you want to run the whole app, you have to set the env variables. All of them can be found in `server/config.js` file. After setting those in you env -

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build

cd ../
npm install
npm start
```
This will basically run the Express app and the build files of React app will be served by express static.

But for development, probably you wouldn't want to build every time. So you can just start the server with `npm start`. And then go to the `/client` directory and start the React development with `npm start`
